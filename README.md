Description

Typical situation: After a long day of coding, you just finished preparing your dinner, you got the perfect company (it migth be just yourself wich is amazing company) and you are ready for a lovely free time watching a movie. You start srcolling through the (insert movie streaming platform here) catalog. Nothing fits your desires. You open the search engine of choice and start reading reviews. After the 20th arclicle on "the best 20 movies to watch while having dinner" you still haven't found **THE MOVIE**, dinner is cold and the before said good company has gone to sleep.

But worry no more!! Just open your web browser and take our quiz!! Each question is designed so that the final result adapts not only to you but also, to how you feel today.
